Hello there! 
Instructions for running this quiz:
- Run quiz.py, this is the actual executable file that will open the quiz in your computer terminal.
- quiz_config.py contains text that you may edit in a text editor or IDE such as quiz questions, answers, blurbs of text, and more.
- quiz_functions.py is a storage file containing all the functions that quiz.py calls on to actually run in order to keep quiz.py
   neat and squeaky clean.

Using this project:
- This is my own work, I would appreciate it if you didn't take it for your own.
- If you have any questions, contact me through Fish#1801 on discord or any of my personal socials if known.

Have fun and thanks for looking at my work o/
